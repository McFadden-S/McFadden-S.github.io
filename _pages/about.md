I am currently undergoing my PhD at King's College London under the supervision of Dr. Fabio Pierazzi. My primary research interest is in the cross section between artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The focus of my thesis is on the application of deep reinforcement learning to cybersecurity, which at the moment has me looking at its application to black-box red team problems. Prior to starting my PhD, I conducted research on machine learning for malware classification in my undergraduate dissertation that won the 'Alan Fairbourn Memorial Prize' and sparked my interest in AI and cybersecurity.
